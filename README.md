## Description:
This Go application is designed to read MySQL binlog files and write the extracted data to a custom log format. The log files generated by this application serve dual purposes: they can be utilized for generating MySQL query backup files, ensuring real-time data backup capabilities, and also serve as a data source for the frontend UI. With its efficient binlog parsing mechanism, this application provides a reliable solution for ensuring data integrity and facilitating data analysis through its web-based user interface.
